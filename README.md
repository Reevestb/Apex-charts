# Exploring data visulisation with Apex Charts

## Simple Charts in React

- See the following documentation for getting started in React https://apexcharts.com/docs/react-charts/
- Simple charts with manual data are relitivly easy to implement
- Something to note if you are not used to onject orientated programming is the 'App' in the example code is the name of your component, you can rename this and plug it into your page if using as a seperate component.
- you can change the 'bar' type chart to 'line' to easily switch between different chart types.
- Some charts will need there own code implementation for example the 'donut' chart.

## Experimenting with an external API

- We manged to fetch an API ok but passing the props into a class component was a real block for us at this point in our learning.

## Experimenting with a realtime dashboard

- After adding stylesheets and adding the code, we can get it to display only if we edit the code and refresh, this is because it is caught in many promises which has given problems with rendering on the page.
- Pitfall: This is because the documentation only specifys Vanilla js, so implementing in React was also a block, translating this took a lot longer then we had in the timeframe. feel free to explore this in your own learning and share with us.
